# android-katas-fragments

## 2
1. Added recyclerview to show list of fragments
* Recycler View (Sub class of ViewGroup)
* Displays list of Child View Objects, one for each item in your list of items
* Instead of creating all views, it creates only the number which fits the screen. IT reuses the view if page is scrolled

Recycler view recyles the TextViews

* Recycler works with Two Classes: Adapter and ViewHolder
* ViewHOlder  It holds on to a Viewâ‹…
* Recycler asks the Adapter to create View Holder
* Adapter binds ViewHolders to data from model layer

Coding:

* Recycler View needs to be requiring LayoutManager (Create layout xml file with Text Views)
* ViewHolder will inflate and own your layout
